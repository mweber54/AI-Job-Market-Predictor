Job Vulnerability to AI Automation Predictor
This project aims to predict the vulnerability of jobs to AI automation. Using a combination of machine learning techniques and interactive data visualization, the project trains a model to predict the "AI Impact" of a job (expressed as a percentage) based on various job features, and then compares the actual AI Impact values with the predictions.

Overview
The goal of this project is to understand and predict how vulnerable different jobs are to automation by AI. The project uses a dataset with job-related features and an "AI Impact" column (e.g., "95%") that indicates a job's susceptibility to automation. A RandomForestRegressor model is trained on this dataset, and then used to predict AI Impact on a separate dataset that does not include the actual impact values.

An interactive visualization using Plotly displays two scatter plots side by side:

Actual AI Impact: Derived from the original dataset.
Predicted AI Impact: Generated by the trained machine learning model.
Both plots use a Cleveland-style dot plot where the x-axis represents the AI Impact (ranging from 0 to 100%) and the y-axis is a numeric index to spread out the points. Job names are hidden from the axis but appear in hover tooltips for clarity.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/job-ai-vulnerability.git
cd job-ai-vulnerability
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn plotly
Usage
Prepare the Data:

Ensure that My_Data.csv contains the training data with the following columns:
Job titiles
AI Impact (as a percentage string, e.g., "95%")
Other job-related features (e.g., Tasks, AI models, AI_Workload_Ratio, Domain)
Ensure that My_Prediction_Data.csv contains the same features as My_Data.csv except for the AI Impact column.
Run the Script:

Execute the main script to train the model, generate predictions, and display interactive visualizations:

bash
Copy
python compare.py
This script will:

Train a RandomForestRegressor model on the training data.
Predict the AI Impact for jobs in the prediction dataset.
Display two interactive scatter plots side by side comparing actual vs. predicted AI Impact values.
Data Preprocessing
Target Column Cleaning:
The AI Impact column is cleaned by removing the % sign and converting it to a numeric value.

Feature Processing:
Non-numeric features (like Job titiles and other categorical variables) are converted to strings and then one-hot encoded using pandas get_dummies.

Standardization:
All features are standardized using scikit-learn's StandardScaler to improve model performance.

Model Training & Prediction
A RandomForestRegressor is trained on the preprocessed training data (from My_Data.csv) to predict the AI Impact.
The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
The trained model is then used to predict AI Impact for new jobs from My_Prediction_Data.csv.
Visualization
The visualization part of the project uses Plotly to create interactive Cleveland dot plots:

Actual Data Plot:
Displays the true AI Impact values from the training dataset.
Predicted Data Plot:
Displays the predicted AI Impact values from the prediction dataset.
Features of the visualization:

The x-axis is set from 0 to 100, representing the percentage of AI Impact.
The y-axis uses a numeric index to spread out the points (job names are hidden but available on hover).
Hover tooltips display the job name and the AI Impact value (formatted to two decimals).
